If a website has a lot of content, maintaining a large set of translations like that can become cumbersome and error-prone. 
Each section of content for every language must be translated manually, which takes time, especially if there are many pages and a wide variety of languages.

To manage this efficiently, many websites use translation services or frameworks that automate or simplify this process. Here are some approaches:

1.Internationalization (i18n) Libraries: JavaScript libraries like i18next or Vue I18n can help manage translations more easily. These libraries allow you to organize translations in JSON or YAML files, avoiding manual duplication across multiple parts of your app.

2.CMS Platforms: Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress, Drupal, or headless CMS platforms offer translation plugins or modules that help you manage content in multiple languages without needing to hard-code each translation.

3.Dynamic Language Loading: Instead of loading all translations upfront, you can load only the language the user selects. This minimizes performance overhead and helps manage translations better.

4.Translation APIs: Services like Google Translate API or Microsoft Translator can dynamically translate content, although for high-quality, human translations, it's better to use pre-translated text.

Using these tools, you can avoid manually writing translations for every content block across every language.
